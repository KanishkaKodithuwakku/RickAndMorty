This task explains the flow between parent and child components, detailing how state is passed from parent to child.

The favoriteList state resides in App.js and is updated from a deeply nested child component. This will help elucidate the data flow within a React app.

Additionally, the project includes an HTTP service named httpClient in the Services directory. This service is reusable and can be employed multiple times. The project also features a custom hook to fetch data from the API, particularly from <a href="https://rickandmortyapi.com">The Rick and Morty API
</a>, which aids in understanding the concept and usage of the custom hook.
